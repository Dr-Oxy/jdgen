# JDGEN WIDGET

The primary objective of JDGEN is to assist job recruiters and companies in generating accurate and tailored job descriptions for various roles they are hiring for. The widget aims to eliminate the common practice of copying and pasting job descriptions that may not fit specific roles, ensuring that the requirements and responsibilities listed are appropriate for the position being advertised.
